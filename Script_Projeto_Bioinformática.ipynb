      "Título: A workflow for the development of template-assisted membrane crystallization downstream processing for monoclonal antibody purification.\n",
      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37697106\n",
      "Resumo: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are commonly used biologic drugs for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, COVID-19 and various cancers. They are produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines and are purified via a number of complex and expensive chromatography-based steps, operated in batch mode, that rely heavily on protein A resin. The major drawback of conventional procedures is the high cost of the adsorption media and the extensive use of chemicals for the regeneration of the chromatographic columns, with an environmental cost. We have shown that conventional protein A chromatography can be replaced with a single crystallization step and gram-scale production can be achieved in continuous flow using the template-assisted membrane crystallization process. The templates are embedded in a membrane (e.g., porous polyvinylidene fluoride with a layer of polymerized polyvinyl alcohol) and serve as nucleants for crystallization. mAbs are flexible proteins that are difficult to crystallize, so it can be challenging to determine the optimal conditions for crystallization. The objective of this protocol is to establish a systematic and flexible approach for the design of a robust, economic and sustainable mAb purification platform to replace at least the protein A affinity stage in traditional chromatography-based purification platforms. The procedure provides details on how to establish the optimal parameters for separation (crystallization conditions, choice of templates, choice of membrane) and advice on analytical and characterization methods.\n",

      "Resumo: Synthetic antibody technologies enable the rapid production of affinity reagents through in vitro selections. The production of synthetic antibodies relies on sophisticated design strategies to produce combinatorial diversity libraries that encode antibody populations optimized for molecular recognition. The technology takes advantage of display technologies that enable amplification, selection and manipulation of antibodies in vitro. The rapid yet highly controlled nature of these methods has opened new avenues in basic and clinical research. Here we review recent advances in structural biology facilitated by synthetic antibodies, as well as advances in library designs and selection methods.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24888905\n",
      "Resumo: A simultaneous crystallization and aqueous two-phase extraction of a single chain antibody was developed, demonstrating process integration. The process conditions were designed to form an aqueous two-phase system, and to favor crystallization, using sodium sulfate and PEG-2000. At sufficiently high concentrations of PEG, a second phase was generated in which the protein crystallization occurred simultaneously. The single chain antibody crystals were partitioned to the top, polyethylene glycol-rich phase. The crystal nucleation took place in the sodium sulfate-rich phase and at the phase boundary, whereas crystal growth was progressing mainly in the polyethylene glycol-rich phase. The crystals in the polyethylene glycol-rich phase grew to a size of >50 µm. Additionally, polyethylene glycol acted as an anti-solvent, thus, it influenced the crystallization yield. A phase diagram with an undersaturation zone, crystallization area, and amorphous precipitation zone was established. Only small differences in polyethylene glycol concentration caused significant shifts of the crystallization yield. An increase of the polyethylene glycol content from 2% (w/v) to 4% (w/v) increased the yield from approximately 63-87%, respectively. Our results show that crystallization in aqueous two-phase systems is an opportunity to foster process integration.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25950968\n",
      "Resumo: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the key players in extracellular signal recognition and their subsequent communications with cellular signaling machinery. Crystallization and high-resolution structure determination of GPCRs has been one of the major advances in the area of GPCR biology over the last 7-8 years. There have primarily been three approaches to GPCR crystallization till date. These are fusion protein strategy, thermostabilization, and antibody fragment-mediated crystallization. Of these, antibody fragment-mediated crystallization has not only provided the first breakthrough in structure determination of a non-rhodopsin GPCR but it has also assisted in obtaining structures of fully active conformations of GPCRs. Antibody fragment approach has also been crucial in obtaining structural information on GPCR signaling complexes. Here, we highlight the specific examples of GPCR crystal structures that have utilized antibody fragments for promoting crystallogenesis and structure solution. We also discuss emerging powerful technologies such as the nanobody technology and the synthetic phage display libraries in the context of GPCR crystallization and underline how these tools are likely to propel key GPCR structural studies in future.\n",

      "Resumo: The atomic-resolution structural information that X-ray crystallography can provide on the binding interface between a Fab and its cognate antigen is highly valuable for understanding the mechanism of interaction. However, many Fab:antigen complexes are recalcitrant to crystallization, making the endeavor a considerable effort with no guarantee of success. Consequently, there have been significant steps taken to increase the likelihood of Fab:antigen complex crystallization by altering the Fab framework. In this investigation, we applied the surface entropy reduction strategy coupled with phage-display technology to identify a set of surface substitutions that improve the propensity of a human Fab framework to crystallize. In addition, we showed that combining these surface substitutions with previously reported Crystal Kappa and elbow substitutions results in an extraordinary improvement in Fab and Fab:antigen complex crystallizability, revealing a strong synergistic relationship between these sets of substitutions. Through comprehensive Fab and Fab:antigen complex crystallization screenings followed by structure determination and analysis, we defined the roles that each of these substitutions play in facilitating crystallization and how they complement each other in the process.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31758731\n",
      "Resumo: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently leading products in the global biopharmaceutical market. Multiple mAbs are in clinical development and novel biotherapeutic protein scaffolds, based on the canonical immunoglobulin G (IgG) fold, are emerging as treatment options for various medical conditions. However, fast approvals for biotherapeutics are challenging to achieve, because of difficult scientific development procedures and complex regulatory processes. Selecting molecular entities with superior physicochemical properties that proceed into clinical trials and the identification of stable formulations are crucial developability aspects. It is widely accepted that the solution pH has critical influences on both the protein's colloidal stability and its crystallization behavior. Furthermore, proteins usually crystallize best at solution conditions that enable high protein solubility, purity, stability, and monodispersity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the solution pH value is a central parameter that is linking together protein formulation, protein crystallization, and thermal protein stability. In order to experimentally test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effect of the solution pH on the thermal stabilities and crystallizabilities for three different mAbs. Combining biophysical measurements with high throughput protein (HTP) crystallization trials we observed a correlation in the buffer pH values for eminent mAb stability and successful crystallization. Specifically, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to determine pH values that exert highest thermal mAb stabilities and additionally led to the identification of unfolding temperatures of individual mAb domains. Independently performed crystallization trials with the same mAbs resulted in their successful crystallization at pH values that displayed highest thermal stabilities. In summary, the presented results suggest a strategy how protein crystallization could be used as a screening method for the development of biotherapeutic protein formulations with improved in vitro stabilities.\n",

      "Resumo: From G protein-coupled receptors to ion channels, membrane proteins represent over half of known drug targets. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is hampered by the dearth of available three-dimensional models for this large category of proteins. Other than efforts to improve membrane protein expression and stability, current strategies to improve the ability of membrane proteins to crystallize involve examining many orthologs and DNA constructs, testing the effects of different detergents for purification and crystallization, creating a lipidic environment during crystallization, and cocrystallizing with covalent or non-covalent soluble protein chaperones with an intrinsic high propensity to crystallize. In this review, we focus on this last category, highlighting successes of crystallization chaperones in membrane protein structure determination and recent developments in crystal chaperone engineering, including molecular display to enhance chaperone crystallizability, and end with a novel generic approach in development to target any membrane protein of interest.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23532914\n",
      "Resumo: The potential of process crystallization for purification of a therapeutic monoclonal IgG1 antibody was studied. The purified antibody was crystallized in non-agitated micro-batch experiments for the first time. A direct crystallization from clarified CHO cell culture harvest was inhibited by high salt concentrations. The salt concentration of the harvest was reduced by a simple pretreatment step. The crystallization process from pretreated harvest was successfully transferred to stirred tanks and scaled-up from the mL-scale to the 1 L-scale for the first time. The crystallization yield after 24 h was 88-90%. A high purity of 98.5% was reached after a single recrystallization step. A 17-fold host cell protein reduction was achieved and DNA content was reduced below the detection limit. High biological activity of the therapeutic antibody was maintained during the crystallization, dissolving, and recrystallization steps. Crystallization was also performed with impure solutions from intermediate steps of a standard monoclonal antibody purification process. It was shown that process crystallization has a strong potential to replace Protein A chromatography. Fast dissolution of the crystals was possible. Furthermore, it was shown that crystallization can be used as a concentrating step and can replace several ultra-/diafiltration steps. Molecular modeling suggested that a negative electrostatic region with interspersed exposed hydrophobic residues on the Fv domain of this antibody is responsible for the high crystallization propensity. As a result, process crystallization, following the identification of highly crystallizable antibodies using molecular modeling tools, can be recognized as an efficient, scalable, fast, and inexpensive alternative to key steps of a standard purification process for therapeutic antibodies.\n",

      "Resumo: The preparation of diffraction quality crystals remains the major bottleneck in macromolecular X-ray crystallography. A crystallization chaperone is an auxiliary protein, such as fragments of monoclonal antibodies, that binds to and increases the crystallization probability of a target molecule of interest. Such chaperones reduce conformational heterogeneity, mask counterproductive surfaces while extending surfaces predisposed to forming crystal contacts, and provide phasing information. Crystallization chaperones generated using recombinant technologies have emerged as superior alternatives that increase the throughput and eliminate inherent limitations associated with antibody production by animal immunization and the hybridoma technology.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193207\n",
      "Resumo: Antibodies are widely used as cancer therapeutics, but their current use is limited by the low number of antigens restricted to cancer cells. A receptor tyrosine kinase, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), is normally expressed only during embryogenesis and is tightly down-regulated in postnatal healthy tissues. However, it is up-regulated in a diverse set of hematologic and solid malignancies, thus ROR2 represents a candidate antigen for antibody-based cancer therapy. Here we describe the affinity maturation and humanization of a rabbit mAb that binds human and mouse ROR2 but not human ROR1 or other human cell-surface antigens. Co-crystallization of the parental rabbit mAb in complex with the human ROR2 kringle domain (hROR2-Kr) guided affinity maturation by heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3)-focused mutagenesis and selection. The affinity-matured rabbit mAb was then humanized by complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting and framework fine tuning and again co-crystallized with hROR2-Kr. We show that the affinity-matured and humanized mAb retains strong affinity and specificity to ROR2 and, following conversion to a T cell-engaging bispecific antibody, has potent cytotoxicity toward ROR2-expressing cells. We anticipate that this humanized affinity-matured mAb will find application for antibody-based cancer therapy of ROR2-expressing neoplasms.\n",

      "Resumo: The application of microseed matrix screening to the crystallization of antibody-antigen complexes is described for a set of antibodies that include mouse anti-IL-13 antibody C836, its humanized version H2L6 and an affinity-matured variant of H2L6, M1295. The Fab fragments of these antibodies were crystallized in complex with the antigen human IL-13. The initial crystallization screening for each of the three complexes included 192 conditions. Only one hit was observed for H2L6 and none were observed for the other two complexes. Matrix self-microseeding using these microcrystals yielded multiple hits under various conditions that were further optimized to grow diffraction-quality H2L6 crystals. The same H2L6 seeds were also successfully used to promote crystallization of the other two complexes. The M1295 crystals appeared to be isomorphous to those of H2L6, whereas the C836 crystals were in a different crystal form. These results are consistent with the concept that the conditions that are best for crystal growth may be different from those that favor nucleation. Microseed matrix screening using either a self-seeding or cross-seeding approach proved to be a fast, robust and reliable method not only for the refinement of crystallization conditions but also to promote crystal nucleation and increase the hit rate.\n",

      "Resumo: Gout is a chronic disease of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Although hyperuricaemia is the central risk factor for development of gout, not all people with hyperuricaemia have subclinical MSU crystal deposition or indeed, symptomatic disease. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify factors that contribute to MSU crystallization. A search was conducted of the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus. Articles were included if they contained original data related to MSU crystallization. The methods and results were summarized and categorized into articles describing at least one of the three key steps in MSU crystallization (reduced urate solubility, nucleation and growth). A total of 2175 articles were initially identified in our systematic search with 35 of these articles included in the final analysis. Elevated urate concentration was identified as a central factor driving all three stages of MSU crystallization. Factors that were found to consistently reduce urate solubility were reduced temperatures, pH 7-9 and various ions including sodium ions. Connective tissue factors including bovine cartilage homogenates and healthy human synovial fluid and serum all enhanced urate solubility. MSU nucleation was found to be increased by a number of factors, including sodium ions, uric acid binding antibodies, and synovial fluid or serum from patients with gout. Other than elevated urate concentrations, no other specific factors were identified as promoters of MSU crystal growth. Increased urate concentration is the key factor required at each stage of MSU crystallization. Different proteins and factors within connective tissues may promote MSU crystallization and may be important for determining the sites at which MSU crystallization occurs in the presence of elevated urate concentrations.\n",

      "Resumo: Technical-scale crystallization of therapeutic proteins may not only allow for a significant cost-reduction in downstream processing, but also enable new applications, e.g., the use of crystal suspensions for subcutaneous drug delivery. In this work, the crystallization of the antigen-binding fragment FabC225 was studied. First, vapor diffusion crystallization conditions from the literature were transferred to 10μL-scale microbatch experiments. A phase diagram was developed in order to identify the crystallization window. The conditions obtained from the microbatch experiments were subsequently transferred to parallelized 5mL-scale stirred-tank crystallizers. This scalable and reproducible agitated crystallization system allowed for an optimization of the crystallization process based on quantitative measurements. The optimized crystallization process resulted in an excellent yield of 99% in less than 2h by increasing the concentration of the crystallization agent ammonium sulfate during the process. The successful scalability of the Fab fragment crystallization process to 100mL-scale crystallizers based on geometric similarity was demonstrated. A favorable crystal size distribution was obtained. Furthermore, a wash step was introduced in order to remove unfavorable low-molecular substances from the crystals.\n",

      "Resumo: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptors play a critical role in linking IgG antibody-mediated immune responses with cellular effector functions. A high resolution map of the binding site on human IgG1 for human Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RIIA, Fc gamma RIIB, Fc gamma RIIIA, and FcRn receptors has been determined. A common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding to all Fc gamma R; Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII also utilize residues outside this common set. In addition to residues which, when altered, abrogated binding to one or more of the receptors, several residues were found that improved binding only to specific receptors or simultaneously improved binding to one type of receptor and reduced binding to another type. Select IgG1 variants with improved binding to Fc gamma RIIIA exhibited up to 100% enhancement in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity using human effector cells; these variants included changes at residues not found at the binding interface in the IgG/Fc gamma RIIIA co-crystal structure (Sondermann, P., Huber, R., Oosthuizen, V., and Jacob, U.

The remaining problematic cases may be approached through techniques such as of combinatorial complex crystallization which uses immunoglobulin binding proteins (IBP). The range of lattices that can be made using this method can be expanded by engineering mutants of IBP domains. We have designed Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L (PpL) mutants with altered immunoglobulin light chain binding characteristics. While the wild type PpL has two binding sites, some of the mutants contact the light chain via only one site. Other mutants have combinations of weakened first and second binding sites that modify their crystallization properties and their packing mode. In this study, we have selected PpL mutants with different behavior and that are most useful for crystallization and we present the various packing modes obtained so far.\n",

      "Resumo: We have reviewed here the three-dimensional structure of an antigen-Fab complex as determined by X-ray crystallographic studies. The antigen is hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), a protein whose three-dimensional structure and antigenic properties are well known. The Fab was prepared from a murine monoclonal anti-HEL antibody, IgGl,kappa, obtained by cell-hybridization techniques. The equilibrium association constant for the complex is 4.5 X 10(7) mol-1. The complex was crystallized and its three-dimensional structure was determined at 6-A and 2.8-A resolution. A three-dimensional model of the structure was built based on electron-density maps and the amino-acid sequence [determined from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones (M. Verhoeyen, C. Berek, J.M. Jarvis, G. Winter, in preparation)]. The three-dimensional structure of the complex shows that 17 antibody residues make close contacts (less than or equal to 4 A) with 16 antigen residues. Fifteen of the contacting antibody residues belong to the six complementarity-determining regions of the light chain (6 residues) and of the heavy chain (9 residues). The remaining two are located in regions of constant or nearly constant sequence [\"framework\" regions]. The 16 contacting lysozyme residues form a discontinuous, topographical determinant, since they are widely separated in the linear amino-acid sequence but are brought to relative spatial proximity by the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain. The contacting surfaces are relatively flat, with protruding side chains of antigen and antibody penetrating each other over an area with maximum dimensions of 30 X 20 A. As in several other systems of protein-protein interactions, the contacts are chemically characterized as van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. Detailed analysis of the interactions reveals that the antibody's recognition of the antigen is finely specific and is affected by antigenic variation (as observed in lysozymes from other avian species). The quaternary structure of the complexed Fab is elongated, with the axes of the variable (VH + VL) and constant (CH1 + CL) domains making an angle close to 180 degrees. Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of the complexed lysozyme with that of native lysozyme showed no significant conformational change at the current resolution (2.8 A). Comparison of the Fab moiety of the complex with other Fabs of known three-dimensional structure suggested that upon complexing no conformational change takes place in the tertiary structure of Fab either.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

To understand the structural changes that occur during Bax activation, we determined the crystal structure of a Bax peptide bound to the 6A7 Fab fragment to a resolution of 2.3 A. The structure reveals the conformation of the 6A7 peptide epitope on Bax in the activated form and elucidates the extensive structural changes that Bax must undergo during the conversion from its native to its activated conformation.\n",

Application of MMS, using the initial screens and/or refinement screens, resulted in diffraction-quality crystals of these Fabs. Five Fabs that failed to give hits in the initial screen were crystallized by cross-seeding MMS followed by MMS optimization.

Characterization of the frozen-thawed samples was performed by circular dichroism, particle analysis, and size exclusion chromatography. At a pH of 3, formation of insoluble and soluble aggregates was observed however, these could be reduced by the use of a surfactant. Cryoprotectant free formulations showed higher monomer content after freeze/thaw. At pH5, a single freeze/thaw cycle did not result in a significant increase in particle numbers.

Knowledge of their three-dimensional structure is important for understanding their antigen-binding mode as well as for protein-engineering approaches such as antibody humanization. A major obstacle to the crystallization of single-chain variable antibody fragments is their relatively poor homogeneity caused by spontaneous oligomerization. A new approach to optimization of the crystallizability of single-chain variable antibody fragments is demonstrated using a representative single-chain variable fragment derived from the anti-CD3 antibody MEM-57. A Thermofluor-based assay was utilized to screen for optimal conditions for antibody-fragment stability and homogeneity.

The Fab fragment of an IgG1 mouse monoclonal carbamatase catalytic antibody JC1 raised against a transition-state analogue, ethyl N-(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-P-[N-[5'-(2\",5\"-dioxo-1\"-pyrrolidinyl)oxy-1',5'-dioxopentyl]-4-aminophenylmethyl]phosphonamidate, was obtained by digestion of the whole antibody with papain and was purified by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. Using hanging-drop vapour-diffusion crystallization techniques, three different crystal forms of the Fab fragment were obtained in the presence and absence of the transition-state analogue. All crystals diffract X-rays to between 3.5 and 3.2 A resolution. The two crystal forms grown in the presence of the transition-state analogue contain up to four or eight copies of the Fab in the asymmetric unit and diffract to 3.5 and 3.2 A, respectively. The crystal of the Fab alone is most likely to contain only two copies of the Fab in the asymmetric unit and diffracts to beyond 3.5 A. Determination of the structure will provide insights into the active-site arrangement of this antibody and will help to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the immune system can evolve catalytic function.\n",

      "Resumo: The variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) genes of NC10, a monoclonal antibody with specificity toward N9 neuraminidase (NA), were cloned and sequenced. A single chain Fv (scFv) fragment of NC10, consisting of VH and VL domains joined by a peptide linker, was designed, constructed and expressed in the E. coli expression vector pPOW. The N-terminal secretion signal PelB directed the synthesized protein into the periplasm where it was associated with the insoluble membrane fraction. An octapeptide (FLAG) tail was fused to the C-terminus of the single chain Fv to aid in its detection and remained intact throughout the protein purification process. NC10 scFv was purified by solubilization of the E. coli membrane fraction with guanidinium hydrochloride followed by column chromatography. The purified NC10 scFv showed binding affinity for its antigen, NA, 2-fold lower than that of the parent Fab. The complex between NA and the scFv has been crystallized by the vapor diffusion method. The crystals are tetragonal, space group P42(1)2, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 141 A, c = 218 A.\n",

      "Resumo: The arenavirus Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa virus, illustrates the unique assembly of the arenavirus glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for vaccine design against these threats to global health.\n",

      "Resumo: We describe the specificity profile and V region sequences of a high-affinity monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3910, directed against oestrone-3-glucuronide (E3G). Inhibition studies show that the D-ring is critical for steroid specificity, while the glucuronic acid attached to the A ring is required for high binding affinity, suggesting that both 'ends' of the E3G ligand are recognized. The VH domain is encoded by a gene from the VH7183 family, while VL appears to be encoded by the Vk5.1 gene (kappa II subgroup) with a deletion of six residues from complementarity-determining region-1 (CDR1). The VH CDR3 is 10 amino acid residues in length, of which D/N contributes five residues. Comparison of VH CDR of 3910 with those of mAb against progesterone (DB3) and digoxin (26-10, 40-50), for which crystal structures have been determined, suggests that aromatic side chains are important for E3G binding and that tyrosine residues H50, H97 and H100 may interact with the ligand. The Fab fragment of 3910 has been crystallized in its native and steroid (E3G and oestriol-3-glucuronide) complexed forms.

      "Resumo: The mechanism of action of therapeutic antibodies can be elucidated from the three-dimensional crystal structures of their complexes with antigens, but crystallization remains the primary bottleneck to structure determination. Methods that resulted in the successful crystallization of TLR3 ECD in complex with Fab fragments from three noncompeting, neutralizing anti-TLR3 antibodies are presented. The crystallization of this 238 kDa complex was achieved through fine purification of the quaternary complex of TLR3 with the three Fab fragments combined with microseed matrix screening and additive screening. Fine purification entailed the application of a very shallow gradient in anion-exchange chromatography, resulting in the resolution of two separate complex peaks which had different crystallizabilities. Subsequent structure determination defined the epitopes of the respective antibodies and revealed a mechanistic hypothesis that is currently under investigation. The results also showed that cocrystallization with multiple noncompeting Fab fragments can be a viable path when an antigen complex with a single Fab proves to be recalcitrant to crystallization.\n",

      "Resumo: Monoclonal antibodies from two-dimensional (2-D) crystals when bound to haptenated phospholipid monolayers in physiological conditions and at ambient temperatures. IgG1 forms two crystal phases: a linear strand phase and a high-order hexagonal phase. The relative distribution of these two phases is dependent on temperature, pH, and salt concentration. This dependence is one that is associated with protein intramolecular interactions rather than lipid-lipid or lipid-protein interactions for a number of reasons: 1) Polyclonal antibodies against the hapten DNP do not organize into any crystal structure for any of the experimental conditions used. 2) Slightly denatured IgG (through storage at 4 degrees C, for example) does not readily crystallize and a shift in the temperature dependence for forming the hexagonal phase is observed. 3) There is no pH driven transition in crystallization tendency for IgE anti-DNP but a transition to disorder is observed at above 30 degrees C. No such transition exists for IgG1. Observation of the dynamics of crystal growth shows a clear and marked dependence on pH and temperature that is in accord with the results of long-term incubations. It is found that high pH retards crystal growth very significantly for IgG1 but not for IgE. Also, the crystal growth rate of 4 degrees C-stored IgG1 is greatly reduced over fresh IgG1 (-80 degrees C stored). Furthermore, it is found that the linear phase of IgG1 is an extremely rapidly forming phase but one that is metastable against the hexagonal phase.\n",

      "Resumo: An antibody fragment that recognizes the tertiary structure of a target protein with high affinity can be utilized as a crystallization chaperone. Difficulties in establishing conformation-specific antibodies, however, limit the applicability of antibody fragment-assisted crystallization. Here, we attempted to establish an alternative method to promote the crystallization of target proteins using an already established anti-tag antibody. The monoclonal antibody NZ-1 recognizes the PA tag with an extremely high affinity. It was also established that the PA tag is accommodated in the antigen-binding pocket in a bent conformation, compatible with an insertion into loop regions on the target. We, therefore, explored the application of NZ-1 Fab as a crystallization chaperone that complexes with a target protein displaying a PA tag. Specifically, we inserted the PA tag into the β-hairpins of the PDZ tandem fragment of a bacterial Site-2 protease. We crystallized the PA-inserted PDZ tandem mutants with the NZ-1 Fab and solved the co-crystal structure to analyze their interaction modes. Although the initial insertion designs produced only moderate-resolution structures, eliminating the solvent-accessible space between the NZ-1 Fab and target PDZ tandem improved the diffraction qualities remarkably. Our results demonstrate that the NZ-1-PA system efficiently promotes crystallization of the target protein. The present work also suggests that β-hairpins are suitable sites for the PA insertion because the PA tag contains a Pro-Gly sequence with a propensity for a β-turn conformation.\n",

      "Resumo: To investigate the cause of unexpected and erratic increase in aggregation during long-term storage of an IgG2 monoclonal antibody in a trehalose formulation at -20°C. Frozen matrix was sampled, stored frozen at various temperatures and analyzed by SEC over time. Aggregation increased with time at -20°C but not at -40°C or -10°C. The cause of the instability was the crystallization of freeze-concentrated trehalose from the frozen solute when the storage temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature of the matrix (-29°C). Crystallization at -20°C deprives the protein of the cryoprotectant, leading to a slow increase in aggregation. Storage at -10°C also leads to crystallization of trehalose but no increase in aggregation. It is hypothesized that significantly higher mobility in the matrix at -10°C allows protein molecules that are unfolded at the ice interface on freezing to refold back before significant aggregation can occur. In contrast, lack of mobility at -40°C prevents crystallization, refolding, and aggregation. Aggregation in the frozen state when stored above the glass transition temperature is a consequence of balance between rate of crystallization leading to loss of cryoprotectant, rate of aggregation of the unfolded protein molecules, and rate of refolding that prevents aggregation.\n",

      "Resumo: Single-chain Fv (sFv) proteins consist of the variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domains of an antibody, covalently joined by an engineered polypeptide linker. We report the crystallization of single-chain Fv's with specificities for fluorescein (4-4-20 sFv) and the TAG-72 pan-carcinoma glycoprotein antigen (CC49 sFv). Concentration of these proteins, preliminary to crystallization, results in a monomer-multimer equilibrium, causing aggregation which interferes with crystallization. Aggregation has been observed to depend primarily on an intact linker between VL and VH domains, although other factors are likely to modulate this phenomenon as well, including the specific identity of Fv and ligand, presence or absence of the ligand, linker length and possibly sequence. We have found two methods to overcome sFv aggregation, both of which yield X-ray diffraction quality crystals. The first, discovered serendipitously, is by introducing a proteolytic clip into the linker region (effectively yielding an Fv fragment). The second is the purification of the sFv dimer form, with linker regions intact, from an equilibrium mixture of aggregates. The sFv molecular association in a dimer is believed to be unusual in that each VL/VH interface may not be formed by the two linker-connected VL and VH domains, but rather by interaction of VL and VH domains from two distinct sFv monomers. Structure determination of the CC49 sFv dimer, with the 14-residue linker designated 212, is underway to test this model. Increasing linker length, to relieve steric strain on the monomer, and inclusion of the appropriate antigen, to slow transitions between monomeric and multimeric forms, may prove valuable strategies with sFv proteins less amenable to crystallization.\n",

      "Resumo: Novel tools and technologies are required to obtain structural information of difficult to crystallize complex biological systems such as membrane proteins, multiprotein assemblies, transient conformational states and intrinsically disordered proteins. One promising approach is to select a high affinity and specificity-binding partner (crystallization chaperone), form a complex with the protein of interest and crystallize the complex. Often the chaperone reduces the conformational freedom of the target protein and additionally facilitates the formation of well-ordered crystals. This review provides an update on the recent successes in chaperone-assisted crystallography. We also stress the importance of synergistic approaches involving protein engineering, crystallization chaperones and crystallization additives. Recent examples demonstrate that investment in such approaches can be key to success.\n",

      "Resumo: Monoclonal antibody therapeutics is an important and fast expanding market. While production of these molecules has been a major area of research, much less is known regarding the stabilization of these proteins for delivery as drugs. Crystallization of antibodies is one such promising route for protein stabilization at high titers, and here we took a systematic approach to initiate crystallization through nucleation in a simple PEG (polyethylene glycol), protein in water solution. A ternary mixture of globular proteins, PEG, and water will undergo a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as shown in a phase diagram or a Binodal curve. Of particular interest within the phase diagram is the position of the critical point, which is where nucleation occurs most rapidly. Detailed LLPS maps were created by increasing concentrations of PEG (from 5% to 11%) and IgG (from 1 to 20 mg/mL). By increasing the molecular weight (MW) of PEG (and hence its radius of gyration) from 1,000 to 6,000 g/mol, the temperatures of the critical point of nucleation were shown to increase. Once these curves were determined, nucleation experiments were conducted close to a chosen critical point (10.5 mg/mL IgG in 11% PEG 1000) and after 3 weeks, crystals of IgG of approximately 100 microm in size were successfully formed. This is the first example of crystallization of an antibody through systematic mapping of LLPS curves, which is a fundamental step towards the scale-up of antibody crystallization.\n",

A subsequent induced-fit isomerization led to high-affinity complexes with a deep and narrow binding site. A protein antigen identified by repertoire selection made use of an unrelated antibody isomer with a wide, shallow binding site.

This region of Abeta has been shown to be the immunodominant B-cell epitope of the peptide and hence is considered to be a basis for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies against this prevalent cause of dementia. Structural studies have been undertaken in order to characterize the molecular basis for antibody recognition of this important epitope.

A case of 16 years' duration was associated with an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy and recurrent uveitis. The corneal changes were unusually extensive and distributed throughout all corneal layers. The deposits consisted of diffuse, small, polymorphic aggregates, which were iridescent in the superficial cornea, mat elsewhere, and associated with a diffuse stromal haze; specular microscopy showed additional features. Both corneas were thickened. The deposits failed to stain histochemically, except patchily with Masson Trichrome. There was extensive immunohistochemical labeling for IgG, kappa, and surprisingly, lambda. Ultrastructurally, pleomorphic deposits were found in every corneal cell; paracrystalline deposits with internal banding were seen only in the basal epithelium. Keratocytes and endothelial cells were damaged and reduced in number. Disease recurred in a corneal graft. Three main types of paraproteinemic keratopathy can be distinguished. The deposits probably represent various metabolic products of the monoclonal protein.

      "Resumo: APOBEC3B (A3B) is one of seven human APOBEC3 DNA cytosine deaminases that restrict viral infections as part of the overall innate immune response, but it also plays a major role in tumor evolution by mutating genomic DNA. Given the importance of A3B as a restriction factor of viral infections and as a driver of multiple human cancers, selective antibodies against A3B are highly desirable for its specific detection in various research and possibly diagnostic applications. Here, we describe a high-affinity minimal antibody, designated 5G7, obtained via a phage display screening against the C-terminal catalytic domain (ctd) of A3B. 5G7 also binds APOBEC3A that is highly homologous to A3Bctd but does not bind the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G, another Z1-type deaminase domain. The crystal structure of 5G7 shows a canonical arrangement of the heavy and light chain variable domains, with their complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops lining an antigen-binding cleft that accommodates a pair of α-helices. To understand the mechanism of A3Bctd recognition by 5G7, we used the crystal structures of A3Bctd and 5G7 as templates and computationally predicted the A3B-5G7 complex structure. Stable binding poses obtained by the simulation were further tested by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro binding analyses. These studies mapped the epitope for 5G7 to a portion of C-terminal α6 helix of A3Bctd, with Arg374 playing an essential role. The same region of A3Bctd was used previously as a peptide antigen for generating a rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb 5210-87-13), suggesting that this region is particularly immunogenic and that these antibodies from very different origins may share similar binding modes. Our studies provide a platform for the development of selective antibodies against A3B and other APOBEC3 family enzymes.\n",

      "Resumo: Monoclonal antibodies constitute one of the largest groups of drugs to treat cancers and immune disorders, and are guiding the design of vaccines against infectious diseases. Fragments antigen-binding (Fabs) have been preferred over monoclonal antibodies for the structural characterization of antibody-antigen complexes due to their relatively low flexibility. Nonetheless, Fabs often remain challenging to crystallize because of the surface characteristics of complementary determining regions and the residual flexibility in the hinge region between the variable and constant domains. Here, we used a variable heavy-chain (V<sub>H</sub>H) domain specific for the human kappa light chain to assist in the structure determination of three therapeutic Fabs that were recalcitrant to crystallization on their own. We show that this ligand alters the surface properties of the antibody-ligand complex and lowers its aggregation temperature to favor crystallization. The V<sub>H</sub>H crystallization chaperone also restricts the flexible hinge of Fabs to a narrow range of angles, and so independently of the variable region. Our findings contribute a valuable approach to antibody structure determination and provide biophysical insight into the principles that govern the crystallization of macromolecules.\n",

      "Resumo: Sorbitol crystallization-induced aggregation of mAbs in the frozen state was evaluated. The effect of protein aggregation resulting from sorbitol crystallization was measured as a function of formulation variables such as protein concentration and pH. Long-term studies were performed on both IgG1 and IgG2 mAbs over the protein concentration range of 0.1-120 mg/mL. Protein aggregation was measured by size-exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC) and further characterized by capillary-electrophoresis SDS. Sorbitol crystallization was monitored and characterized by subambient differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Aggregation due to sorbitol crystallization is inversely proportional to both protein concentration and formulation pH. At high protein concentrations, sorbitol crystallization was suppressed, and minimal aggregation by SE-HPLC resulted, presumably because of self-stabilization of the mAbs. The glass transition temperature (Tg ') and fragility index measurements were made to assess the influence of molecular mobility on the crystallization of sorbitol. Tg ' increased with increasing protein concentration for both mAbs.

      "Resumo: Crystallizing RNA has been an imperative and challenging task in the world of RNA research. Assistive methods such as chaperone-assisted RNA crystallography (CARC), employing monoclonal antibody fragments (Fabs) as crystallization chaperones have enabled us to obtain RNA crystal structures by forming crystal contacts and providing initial phasing information. Despite the early successes, the crystallization of large RNA-Fab complex remains a challenge in practice. The possible reason for this difficulty is that the Fab scaffold has not been optimized for crystallization in complex with RNA. Here, we have used the surface entropy reduction (SER) technique for the optimization of ΔC209 P4-P6/Fab2 model system. Protruding lysine and glutamate residues were mutated to a set of alanines or serines to construct Fab2SMA or Fab2SMS. Expression with the shake flask approach was optimized to allow large scale production for crystallization. Crystal screening shows that significantly higher crystal-forming ratio was observed for the mutant complexes. As the chosen SER residues are far away from the CDR regions of the Fab, the same set of mutations can now be directly applied to other Fabs binding to a variety of ribozymes and riboswitches to improve the crystallizability of Fab-RNA complex.\n",

The CD3 complex comprises the CD3epsilongamma and CD3epsilondelta heterodimers and the CD3zetazeta homodimer. Here, the expression of the human CD3epsilongamma and CD3epsilondelta heterodimers, both of which were expressed as single-chain polypeptides, is reported.

      "Resumo: Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exert their effects via binding to specific target molecules, which is expected to show rare off-target adverse reactions. However, nonclinical evaluation of mAbs is difficult because they often lack reactivity toward orthologous targets in animals. During the nonclinical evaluation of mAbs, not only the target molecules but fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptors, which regulate the immune effector functions and pharmacokinetic properties of mAbs, should be considered. In this review, factors for extrapolating nonclinical study results to clinical settings are discussed by focusing on Fc receptors. The human Fcγ receptor family consists of FcγRI, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb; Fcγ receptors in laboratory animals are structurally and functionally different from those in humans. In addition, interactions between human IgG-Fc, a component of therapeutic mAbs, and animal Fcγ receptors are still not fully understood. With regard to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), related molecules comprising the FcRn family are not known; however, critical amino acid residues involved in IgG binding are different between human and mouse. In case of next-generation mAbs with a novel structure or mode of action, knowledge from related drugs is limited. To ensure safety of next-generation mAbs, a thorough understanding of the differences in Fc receptors among species and the interactions between mAbs and Fc receptors is required, and the appropriateness of the nonclinical study design should be carefully examined prior to conducting clinical studies.\n",

      "Resumo: The antibody Fv fragment 7E2 has previously been employed in the induced crystallization of the integral membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans. The 1.3 A X-ray structure of the uncomplexed antibody fragment reveals conserved water networks on the surfaces of the framework regions. A novel consensus motif for water coordination, XX(S/T), is found along the edges of the beta-sandwich, where a water molecule forms hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl O atom of a residue at position N and the OG hydroxyl groups of conserved serines or threonines at position N + 2. Multiple conformations were found in the hydrophobic core for residues IleL21, LeuL33 and the disulfide bridges. An internal water molecule that is compatible with only one of the three packing states of the V(L) core suggests local 'breathing' of the variable domain. TrpH47, a conserved key residue of the V(H)/V(L) interface, is crucially involved in the formation of the antigen-binding site by adopting a novel conformation that specifically stabilizes the non-canonical CDR-L3 loop. Finally, a comparison with 7E2-cytochrome c oxidase complexes demonstrates that binding of this membrane-bound antigen proceeds without major conformational changes of the 7E2 antibody fragment.\n",

      "Resumo: Crystallization holds the potential to be used for protein purification and low-viscosity drug substance and drug product formulations. Twenty-two different proteins (20 monoclonal antibodies and two Fc-fusions) were examined to determine the breadth of applicability of crystallization to these therapeutic proteins. Vapor diffusion technique and an evaporative screening method were used to identify crystallization conditions using around a 100 initial conditions based on reagents that are generally regarded as safe (GRAS). Of 16 IgG2 s examined, at least four formed diffraction-quality crystals and four others formed crystal-like particles. At least three of the IgG2 s that crystallized well were also crystallized under the same set of operating conditions using inexpensive GRAS reagents. The crystals were formed to high-yields in a few hours and were dissolved quickly without impacting product quality. Although only a fraction of the proteins examined crystallized, all exhibited liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which could be used for their concentration or possibly purification. One of the Fc-fusions, for example, was concentrated by LLPS to a self-buffering solution at 150 g/L. Crystallization and LLPS in the salting-in region were shown to be feasible.\n",

A humanized E6F6 antibody B11 with affinity loss was obtained by CDR-grafting approach. To address this issue, in silico affinity maturation through scanning mutagenesis using CHARMM force field methods was performed on an predicted immune complex model of the B11:HBsAg. We chose four variants with top increased interaction energy for further characterization. The antibody huE6F6-1 within two point mutations (Heavy Chain: Asp65Val; His66Leu) was identified to restore the parental antibody's high binding affinity, neutralization activity, and potent efficacy of viral suppression in vivo. Crystal structure (1.8 Å resolution) based molecular docking proved more stabilized and compact hydrogen bond interactions formed in huE6F6-1.The smaller and dispersed HBV immune complexes of huE6F6-1 by electron microscopy suggested it will have the same therapeutic efficacy as the parental E6F6 mAb. Preclinical study and pharmacokinetics of huE6F6-1 demonstrated that it is a stable and desirable lead candidate to improve the clinical management of CHB.

An improved understanding of protein phase behavior is, therefore, important for developing rational design strategies for important process steps. This work explores the phase behavior of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), IDEC-152, which exhibits liquid-liquid separation, aggregation, gelation, and crystallization. A systematic study of numerous factors, including the effects of solution composition and pH, has been conducted to explore the phase behavior of this antibody. Phenomena observed include a significant dependence of the cloud point on the cation in sulfate salts and nonmonotonic trends in pH dependence. Additionally, conditions for crystallization of this mAb are reported for the first time. Protein-protein interactions, as determined from the osmotic second virial coefficient, are used to interpret the phase behavior.\n",

      "Resumo: Exciting breakthroughs in the last two years have begun to elucidate the structural basis of cellular immune recognition. Crystal structures have been determined for full-length and truncated forms of alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) heterodimers, both alone and in complex with their peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands or with anti-TCR antibodies. In addition, a truncated CD8 coreceptor has been visualized with a pMHC. Aided in large part by the substantial body of knowledge accumulated over the last 25 years on antibody structure, a number of general conclusions about TCR structure and its recognition of antigen can already be derived from the relatively few TCR structures that have been determined. Small, but important, variations between TCR and antibody structures bear on their functional differences as well as on their specific antigen recognition requirements. As observed in antibodies, canonical CDR loop structures are already emerging for some of the TCR CDR loops. Highly similar docking orientations of the TCR V alpha domains in the TCR/pMHC complex appear to play a primary role in dictating orientation, but the V beta positions diverge widely. Similar TCR contact positions, but whose exact amino acid content can vary, coupled with relatively poor interface shape complementarity, may explain the flexibility and short half-lives of many TCR interactions with pMHC. Here we summarize the current state of this field, and suggest that the knowledge gap between the three-dimensional structure and the signaling function of the TCR can be bridged through a synthesis of molecular biological and biophysical techniques.\n",

      "Resumo: Since its first emergence in East China in early 2013, many cases of avian influenza A H7N9 have been reported. The disease has extended to 22 provinces in mainland China and some surrounding areas. Strategies to combat viral infection are urgently needed. We previously isolated a human monoclonal antibody, HNIgGA6, that neutralized the H7N9 virus both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> In this study, we determined the crystal structure of viral hemagglutinin (HA) globular head bound to the fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) of HNIgGA6. The crystal structure shows that the tip of the HNIgGA6 heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) directly interposes into the receptor binding site (RBS) and mimics, in many respects, the interaction of the sialic acid receptor. Three residues at Y98, H183, and E190, which are critical to human cellular receptor binding, are also essential for HNIgGA6 recognition. Meanwhile, dual mutations at V186G and L226Q in RBS were able to disrupt viral HA1 binding with the antibody. Our study provides a better understanding of the mechanism for protective antibody recognition and a sound foundation for the design of therapeutic drugs and vaccines against H7N9 influenza.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Neutralization by antibody is one of the most important mechanisms for a host to defend against viral infections. Human-originated antibody HNIgGA6 was generated in response to the natural infectious H7N9 virus and showed potential for use in suppression of H7N9 infection, with possible therapeutic implications. The crystal structure of the HNIgGA6/HA1 complex provided new insight into the protective immune response to H7N9 virus in humans, as well as possibilities for the development of effective H7N9 pandemic vaccines and antiviral molecules.\n",

The data for IgG4 (S228P), an antibody targeting the natriuretic peptide receptor A, show a previously unrecognized type of Fab-Fc orientation with a distorted λ-shape in which one Fab-arm is oriented toward the Fc portion. Detailed structural analysis by x-ray crystallography and molecular simulations suggest that this is one of several conformations coexisting in a dynamic equilibrium state. These results were confirmed by small angle x-ray scattering in solution. Furthermore, electron microscopy supported these findings by preserving molecule classes of different conformations. This study fosters our understanding of IgG4 in particular and our appreciation of antibody flexibility in general. Moreover, we give insights into potential biological implications, specifically for the interaction of human anti-natriuretic peptide receptor A IgG4 with the neonatal Fc receptor, Fcγ receptors, and complement-activating C1q by considering conformational flexibility.\n",

In this study, a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment which recognizes the same region of PTHrP as its receptor, PTH1R, was used to aid in the crystallization of PTHrP. The resultant protein complex was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with polyethylene glycol as a precipitant. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 72.6, b = 96.3, c = 88.5 A, and diffracted to 2.0 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. The crystal structure will shed light on the nature of the key residues of PTHrP that interact with the antibody and will provide insights into how the antibody is able to discriminate between PTHrP and the related molecule parathyroid homone.\n",

      "Resumo: The crystallization of Anti-CD20, a full-length monoclonal antibody, has been studied in the PEG400/Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/Water system near Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) conditions by both sitting-drop vapour diffusion and batch methods. In order to understand the Anti-CD20 crystallization propensity in the solvent system of different compositions, we investigated some measurable parameters, normally used to assess protein conformational and colloidal stability in solution, with the aim to understand the aggregation mechanism of this complex biomacromolecule. We propose that under crystallization conditions a minor population of specifically aggregated protein molecules are present. While this minor species hardly contributes to the measured average solution behaviour, it induces and promotes crystal formation. The existence of this minor species is the result of the LLPS occurring concomitantly under crystallization conditions.\n",

      "Resumo: Microwave-assisted freeze-drying (MFD) is a rapid drying process well known in food technology. However, little is known about its application to biologicals. In this study, we investigated the applicability and feasibility of this technology to different monoclonal antibody formulations and the influence on the resulting product properties. Moreover, one of our main objectives was to study if significant reductions in drying times could be achieved. In addition, the effect of the drying process on the accelerated stability of a sucrose-based antibody formulation at 40°C and 25°C over 12 weeks was investigated. MFD resulted in drying time reduction >75%. For all model formulations, cake appearance and solid state properties were found to be comparable to standard lyophilized products. These formulations covered a wider range of lyophilization excipients comprising sucrose and trehalose, semi-crystalline forming solids like mannitol:sucrose mixtures and others like arginine phosphate and a mixture of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin with sucrose. Moreover, comparable low changes in relative monomer content, the relative amount of soluble aggregates and cumulative particles ≥1 μm per mL were observed over 12 weeks of storage, regardless of the drying technology. This makes MFD a promising innovative alternative for the rapid production of freeze-dried biologicals while maintaining product quality.\n",

      "Resumo: Antibodies at high concentrations often reveal unanticipated biophysical properties suboptimal for therapeutic development. The purpose of this work was to explore the use of point mutations based on crystal structure information to improve antibody physical properties such as viscosity and phase separation (LLPS) at high concentrations. An IgG4 monoclonal antibody (Mab4) that exhibited high viscosity and phase separation at high concentration was used as a model system. Guided by the crystal structure, four CDR point mutants were made to evaluate the role of hydrophobic and charge interactions on solution behavior. Surprisingly and unpredictably, two of the charge mutants, R33G and N35E, showed a reduction in viscosity and a lower propensity to form LLPS at high concentration compared to the wild-type (WT), while a third charge mutant S28K showed an increased propensity to form LLPS compared to the WT. A fourth mutant, F102H, had reduced hydrophobicity, but unchanged viscosity and phase separation behavior. We further evaluated the correlation of various biophysical measurements including second virial coefficient (A2), interaction parameter (kD), weight-average molecular weight (WAMW), and hydrodynamic diameters (DH), at relatively low protein concentration (4 to 15 mg/mL) to physical properties, such as viscosity and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), at high concentration. Surprisingly, kD measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) at low antibody concentration correlated better with viscosity and phase separation than did A2 for Mab4. Our results suggest that the high viscosity and phase separation observed at high concentration for Mab4 are mainly driven by charge and not hydrophobicity.\n",

      "Resumo: Crystallization of IgG antibodies has important applications in the fields of structural biology, biotechnology, and biopharmaceutics. However, a rational approach to crystallize antibodies is still lacking. In this work, we report a method to estimate the solubility of antibodies at various temperatures. We experimentally determined the full phase diagram of an IgG antibody. Using the full diagram, we examined the metastability gaps, i.e., the distance between the crystal solubility line and the liquid-liquid coexistence curve, of IgG antibodies. By comparing our results to the partial phase diagrams of other IgGs reported in literature, we found that IgG antibodies have similar metastability gaps. Thereby, we present an equation with two phenomenological parameters to predict the approximate location of the solubility line of IgG antibodies with respect to their liquid-liquid coexistence curves. We have previously shown that the coexistence curve of an antibody solution can be readily determined by the polyethylene glycol-induced liquid-liquid phase separation method. Combining the polyethylene glycol-induced liquid-liquid phase separation measurements and the phenomenological equation in this article, we provide a general and practical means to predict the thermodynamic conditions for crystallizing IgG antibodies in the solution environments of interest.\n",

      "Resumo: Protein crystallization is dependent upon, and sensitive to, the intermolecular contacts that assist in ordering proteins into a three-dimensional lattice. Here we used protein engineering and mutagenesis to affect the crystallization of single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that recognize the EE epitope (EYMPME) with high affinity. These hypercrystallizable scFvs are under development to assist difficult proteins, such as membrane proteins, in forming crystals, by acting as crystallization chaperones. Guided by analyses of intermolecular crystal lattice contacts, two second-generation anti-EE scFvs were produced, which bind to proteins with installed EE tags. Surprisingly, although noncomplementarity determining region (CDR) lattice residues from the parent scFv framework remained unchanged through the processes of protein engineering and rational design, crystal lattices of the derivative scFvs differ. Comparison of energy calculations and the experimentally-determined lattice interactions for this basis set provides insight into the complexity of the forces driving crystal lattice choice and demonstrates the availability of multiple well-ordered surface features in our scFvs capable of forming versatile crystal contacts.\n",

      "Resumo: Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE antibody that inhibits the binding of IgE to its receptors on mast cells and basophils, thus blocking the IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediators from these cells. Omalizumab binds to the Fc domains of IgE in proximity to the binding site of the high-affinity IgE receptor FcℇRI, but the epitope and the mechanisms and conformations governing the recognition remain unknown. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its anti-IgE activity, the aim was to analyse the interaction of omalizumab with human IgE. Therefore, IgE Fc Cℇ2-4 was recombinantly produced in mammalian HEK-293 cells. Functionality of the IgE Fc was proven by ELISA and mediator-release assays. Omalizumab IgG was cleaved with papain and the resulting Fab was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The complex of IgE Fc with omalizumab was prepared by size-exclusion chromatography. However, crystals containing the complex were not obtained, suggesting that the process of crystallization favoured the dissociation of the two proteins. Instead, two structures of the omalizumab Fab with maximum resolutions of 1.9 and 3.0 Å were obtained. The structures reveal the arrangement of the CDRs and the position of omalizumab residues known from prior functional studies to be involved in IgE binding. Thus, the structure of omalizumab provides the structural basis for understanding the function of omalizumab, allows optimization of the procedure for complex crystallization and poses questions about the conformational requirements for anti-IgE activity.\n",

      "Resumo: Macromolecular bioproducts like therapeutic proteins have usually been crystallized with µL-scale vapor diffusion experiments for structure determination by X-ray diffraction. Little systematic know-how exists for technical-scale protein crystallization in stirred vessels. In this study, the Fab-fragment of the therapeutic antibody Canakinumab was successfully crystallized in a stirred-tank reactor on a 6 mL-scale. A four times faster onset of crystallization of the Fab-fragment was observed compared to the non-agitated 10 µL-scale. Further studies on a liter-scale with lysozyme confirmed this effect. A 10 times faster onset of crystallization was observed in this case at an optimum stirrer speed. Commonly suggested scale-up criteria (i.e., minimum stirrer speed to keep the protein crystals in suspension or constant impeller tip speed) were shown not to be successful. Therefore, the criterion of constant maximum local energy dissipation was applied for scale-up of the stirred crystallization process for the first time. The maximum local energy dissipation was estimated by measuring the drop size distribution of an oil/surfactant/water emulsion in stirred-tank reactors on a 6 mL-, 100 mL-, and 1 L-scale. A comparable crystallization behavior was achieved in all stirred-tank reactors when the maximum local energy dissipation was kept constant for scale-up. A maximum local energy dissipation of 2.2 W kg(-1) was identified to be the optimum for lysozyme crystallization at all scales under study.\n",

The co-crystal structure of a fully glycosylated SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-gp120 core in complex with rhesus CD4 and the antigen-binding fragment of ITS90.03 at 2.5-Å resolution revealed that ITS90 recognized an epitope comprised of 45% glycan. SIV-gp120 core, rhesus CD4, and their complex could each be aligned structurally to their human counterparts. The structure revealed that glycans masked most of the SIV Env protein surface, with ITS90 targeting a glycan hole, which is occupied in ∼83% of SIV strains by glycan N238. Overall, the SIV glycan shield appears to functionally resemble its HIV counterpart in coverage of spike, shielding from antibody, and modulation of receptor accessibility.\n",

      "Resumo: Co-crystallization of membrane proteins with antibody fragments may emerge as a general tool to facilitate crystal growth and improve crystal quality. The bound antibody fragment enlarges the hydrophilic part of the mostly hydrophobic membrane protein, thereby increasing the interaction area for possible protein-protein contacts in the crystal. Additionally, it may restrain flexible parts or lock the membrane protein in a defined conformational state. For successful co-crystallization trials, the antibody fragments must be stable in detergents during the extended period of crystal growth and must be easily produced in amounts necessary for crystallography. Therefore, we constructed a library of antibody Fab fragments from a framework subset of the HuCAL GOLD library (Morphosys, Munich, Germany). By combining the most stable and well expressed frameworks, V(H)3 and V(kappa)3, with the further stabilizing constant domains, a Fab library with the desired properties was obtained in a standard phage display format. As a proof of principle, we selected binders with phage display against the detergent-solubilized citrate transporter CitS of Klebsiella pneumoniae. We describe efficient methods for the immobilization of the membrane protein during selection, for ELISA screening, and for BIAcore evaluation. We demonstrate that the selected Fab fragments form stable complexes with native CitS and recognize conformational epitopes with affinities in the low nanomolar range.\n",

      "Resumo: The crystalline state of proteins is deemed as a promising formulation platform for biopharmaceuticals. However, a stabilizing effect of protein crystal suspensions is controversially discussed. In fact, antibodies can display an increased aggregation and particle formation profile after the crystallization process compared with liquid or solid amorphous formulations. Nevertheless, studies regarding aggregate formation and its origin remain meager in literature. It was the aim of this study to investigate these aspects for a model IgG antibody (mAb1), which shows an increased aggregate formation after crystallization with polyethylene glycol. The presence of a dynamic equilibrium, a steady exchange of protein between the crystals and the supernatant, was demonstrated by replacing the supernatant with an identical but fluorescence-labeled protein solution and followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Aggregate formation was monitored by size exclusion high-pressure chromatography and flow cytometry. Constantly increasing aggregate levels were found for the crystal fraction and for the supernatant. For the later, markedly higher particle counts were detected. The labeled supernatant and the unlabeled protein crystals allowed a precise identification of the origin of the aggregates. The rising aggregate fractions of the crystals displayed high mean fluorescence intensities that elucidated their origin in the supernatant.\n",

      "Resumo: Recombinant human interferon alpha-2A (rhIFN-alpha-2A) has been crystallized in complex with the recombinantly produced Fab fragment of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (MEDI545; IgG1/kappa) which targets several human interferon alpha subtypes. This constitutes the first reported crystals of a human type I interferon bound to an antibody. The orthorhombic crystals belonged to either space group I222 or I2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 134.82, b = 153.26, c = 163.49 A. The diffraction of the crystals extended to 3.0 A resolution. The asymmetric unit contained two Fab-rhIFN-alpha-2A complexes. This corresponded to a crystal volume per protein weight (V(M)) of 3.02 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 59.3%. The corresponding three-dimensional structure is expected to shed light on the mechanism of action of MEDI545 and the molecular basis of its specificity.\n",

      "Resumo: Understanding binding related changes in antibody conformations is important for epitope prediction and antibody refinement. The increase of available data in the PDB allowed a more detailed investigation of the conformational landscape for free and bound antibodies. A dataset containing a total of 835 unique PDB entries of antibodies that were crystallized in complex with their antigen and in a free state was constructed. It was examined for binding related conformation changes. We present further evidence supporting the theory of a pre-existing-equilibrium in experimental data. Multiple sequence alignments did not show binding induced tendencies in the solvent accessibility of residues in any specific position. Evaluating the changes in solvent accessibility per residue revealed a certain binding induced increase for several amino acids. Antibody-antigen interaction statistics were established and quantify a significant directional asymmetry between many interacting antibody and antigen residue pairs, especially a richness in tyrosine in the antibody epitope compared to its paratope. This asymmetry could potentially facilitate an increase in the success rate of computationally guided antibody refinement.\n",

      "Resumo: Poor solubility is a common challenge encountered during the development of high concentration monoclonal antibody (mAb) formulations, but there are currently no methods that can provide predictive information on high-concentration behavior of mAbs in early discovery. We explored the utility of methodologies used for determining extrapolated solubility as a way to rank-order mAbs based on their relative solubility properties. We devised two approaches to accomplish this: 1) vapor diffusion technique utilized in traditional protein crystallization practice, and 2) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced precipitation and quantitation by turbidity. Using a variety of in-house mAbs with known high-concentration behavior, we demonstrated that both approaches exhibited reliable predictability of the relative solubility properties of these mAbs. Optimizing the latter approach, we developed a format that is capable of screening a large panel of mAbs in multiple pH and buffer conditions. This simple, material-saving, high-throughput approach enables the selection of superior molecules and optimal formulation conditions much earlier in the antibody discovery process, prior to time-consuming and material intensive high-concentration studies.\n",

      "Resumo: HER2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, has been associated with human breast, ovarian and gastric cancers. Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated clinical efficacy for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. A chimeric antibody chA21 that specifically inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo has previously been developed. To reduce a potential human anti-mouse immune response, the humanized antibody HuA21 was developed and was further subjected to affinity maturation by phage display on the basis of chA21. Here, the crystal structure of HuA21-scFv in complex with the extracellular domain of HER2 is reported, which demonstrates that HuA21 binds almost the same epitope as chA21 and also provides insight into how substitutions in HuA21 improve the binding affinity compared with chA21, which could facilitate structure-based optimization in the future. Furthermore, the effects of HuA21 variants with constant domains of different lengths were explored and it was noticed that the deletion of constant domain 1 could improve the inhibition efficacy in a cell-proliferation assay, possibly functioning via increased internalization, which might guide the design of other monoclonal antibodies.\n",

      "Resumo: CCN1, also named Cyr61 (cysteine-rich protein 61), is the first identified member of the CCN family that is composed of 6 secreted extracellular matrix-associated glycoproteins. CCN1 has been demonstrated to participate in pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis through various pathways. A monoclonal antibody, namely, 093G9, is effective to antagonize the effects of CCN1 and hence has potential therapeutic benefits against rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we show that the epitope recognized by 093G9 is mapped to residues 77 to 80 of CCN1, and a cyclic peptide encompassing residues 75 to 81 of CCN1 displays high binding affinity for 093G9. The crystal structure of the 093G9 Fab in complex with the cyclic peptide was determined at 2.7 Å resolution, which reveals the intensive interactions between CCN1 and 093G9. Particularly, residues Asn79 and Phe80 of CCN1 are inserted into cavities mainly formed by residues of complementarity-determining region loop L3 and framework region L2 and by residues of complementarity-determining region loops H2 and H3, respectively, which contribute most of the interactions and therefore are critical for the recognition by 093G9. Together, these findings not only identify the epitope of CCN1 for 093G9 but also reveal the molecular mechanism of recognition and binding of CCN1 by 093G9.\n",

      "Resumo: The three-dimensional structure of an unusually active hydrolytic antibody with a phosphonate transition state analog (hapten) bound to the active site has been solved to 2.5 A resolution. The antibody (17E8) catalyzes the hydrolysis of norleucine and methionine phenyl esters and is selective for amino acid esters that have the natural alpha-carbon L configuration. A plot of the pH-dependence of the antibody-catalyzed reaction is bell-shaped with an activity maximum at pH 9.5; experiments on mechanism lend support to the formation of a covalent acyl-antibody intermediate. The structural and kinetic data are complementary and support a hydrolytic mechanism for the antibody that is remarkably similar to that of the serine proteases. The antibody active site contains a Ser-His dyad structure proximal to the phosphorous atom of the bound hapten that resembles two of the three components of the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of serine proteases. The antibody active site also contains a Lys residue to stabilize oxyanion formation, and a hydrophobic binding pocket for specific substrate recognition of norleucine and methionine side chains. The structure identifies active site residues that mediate catalysis and suggests specific mutations that may improve the catalytic efficiency of the antibody. This high resolution structure of a catalytic antibody-hapten complex shows that antibodies can converge on active site structures that have arisen through natural enzyme evolution.\n",

      "Resumo: This study provides the first systematic investigation of the impact of the nucleation protocol during freeze-drying on physico-chemical properties and long-term stability of two IgG1 antibodies in sugar formulations. We hypothesized that the lower specific surface area (SSA) generated by controlled nucleation could be beneficial for the stability of interface sensitive proteins. The study compares controlled nucleated (CN) and randomly nucleated (RN) lyophilizates with high and low antibody concentrations stored at different temperatures. Formulations with and without polysorbate (PS) were included. In the \"high concentration\" study the formulation without PS showed reduced particle formation for CN samples compared to RN samples. PS containing formulations had an overall lower particle level with no further advantage of CN on stability. Besides the intended comparison of CN and RN samples, we observed that PS promoted sucrose crystallization in both low concentration antibody studies during storage. Additionally, our results indicate that the nucleation temperature (T<sub>N</sub>) was not the only determining factor for the resulting ice crystal size and consequently the product`s SSA. Overall, the application of CN had neither a positive nor a negative impact on the product's physico-chemical stability. The surfactant had a much higher stabilizing effect than the reduction of the SSA by CN.\n",

      "Resumo: The bilayer-tethered vesicle assembly has recently been proposed as a biomimetic model membrane platform for the analysis of integral membrane proteins. Here, we explore the binding of antibodies to membrane components of the vesicle assembly through the use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The technique provides a quantitative, label-free avenue to study binding processes at membrane surfaces. However, converting the signal generated upon binding to the actual amount of antibody bound has been a challenge for a viscoelastic system such as the tethered vesicle assembly. In this work, we first established an empirical relationship between the amount of bound antibody and the corresponding QCM-D response. Then, the results were examined in the context of an existing model describing the QCM-D response under a variety of theoretical loading conditions. As a model system, we investigated the binding of monoclonal antidinitrophenyl (DNP) IgG(1) to tethered vesicles displaying DNP hapten groups. The measured frequency and dissipation responses upon binding were compared to an independent measure of the amount of bound antibody obtained through the use of an in situ ELISA assay. At saturation, the surface mass density of bound antibody was approximately 900 ng/cm(2). Further, through the application of QCM-D models that describe the response of the quartz when loaded by either a single homogeneous viscoelastic film or by a two-layered viscoelastic film, we found that a homogeneous, one-layer model accurately predicts the amount of antibody bound to the tethered vesicles near antibody surface saturation, but a two-layer model must be invoked to accurately describe the kinetic response of the dissipation factor, which suggests that the binding of the antibody results in a stiffening of the top layer of the film.\n",

Understanding an antibody's molecular recognition mechanism for peptide is important for developing clones with a higher specificity and affinity. Here, the author reviews recent progresses in flexible peptide recognition by an antibody using several biophysical techniques, including X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations and calorimetric measurements. A set of two reports highlight the importance of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that form in an unbound flexible state. Such intramolecular hydrogen bonds restrict the fluctuation of the peptide and reduce the conformational entropy, resulting in the destabilization of the unbound state and increasing the binding affinity by increasing the free energy change. These detailed analyses will aid in the antibody design in the future.\n",

Several PrPs structures have been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques; however, only three structures were solved by X-ray crystallography. Here we combined in-situ proteolysis with automated microseed matrix screening (MMS) to crystallize two different PrP(C)-nanobody (Nb) complexes. Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies of camelids. Initial crystallization screening conditions using in-situ proteolysis of mouse prion (23-230) in complex with a nanobody (Nb_PrP_01) gave thin needle aggregates, which were of poor diffraction quality. Next, we used these microcrystals as nucleants for automated MMS. Good-quality crystals were obtained from mouse PrP (89-230)/Nb_PrP_01, belonged to the monoclinic space group P 1 21 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 59.13, b = 63.80, c = 69.79 Å, β = 101.96° and diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation.

Although antibodies to cholesterol conjugates have been reported, cholesterol is widely regarded as a poorly immunogenic substance. Monoclonal IgM complement-fixing antibodies to cholesterol were obtained in the present study after immunizing mice with liposomes containing high amounts of cholesterol (71 mol % relative to phosphatidylcholine) and lipid A as an adjuvant. Clones were selected for the ability of secreted antibodies to react with liposomes containing 71% cholesterol but not with liposomes containing 43% cholesterol. The antibodies also reacted with crystalline cholesterol in a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binding of monoclonal antibodies to the surface of crystalline cholesterol was demonstrated by electron microscopy by utilizing a second antibody (anti-IgM) labeled with colloidal gold. The immunization period required to induce monoclonal antibodies was very short (3 days) and a high fraction of the hybrid cells (at least 70%) were secreting detectable antibodies to cholesterol. The results demonstrate that cholesterol can be a highly immunogenic molecule and that complement-fixing antibodies to cholesterol can be readily obtained.\n",

      "Resumo: Polyethylene glycols (PEG) represent the most successful and frequently applied class of excipients used for protein crystallization. PEG auto-oxidation and formation of impurities such as peroxides and formaldehydes that foster protein drug degradation is known. However, their effect on mAb crystallization has not been studied in detail before. During the present study, a model IgG1 antibody (mAb1) was crystallized in PEG solutions. Aggregate formation was observed during crystallization and storage that was ascribed to PEG degradation products. Reduction of peroxide and formaldehyde levels prior to crystallization by vacuum and freeze-drying was investigated for its effect on protein degradation. Vacuum drying was superior in removal of peroxides but inferior in reducing formaldehyde residues. Consequently, double purification allowed extensive removal of both impurities. Applying of purified PEG led to 50% lower aggregate fractions. Surprisingly, PEG double purification or addition of methionine prior to crystallization prevented crystal formation. With increased PEG concentration or spiking with peroxides and formaldehydes, crystal formation could be recovered again. With these results, we demonstrate that minimum amounts of oxidizing impurities and thus in consequence chemically altered proteins are vital to initiate mAb1 crystallization. The present study calls PEG as good precipitant for therapeutic biopharmaceuticals into question.\n",

To surmount these difficulties, we used probability analysis to determine the most effective crystallization approach and derive equations which show that a strategy, which we term variational crystallization, substantially enhances the overall probability of crystallization for gp120. Variational crystallization focuses on protein modification as opposed to crystallization screening. Multiple variants of gp120 were analyzed with an iterative cycle involving a limited set of crystallization conditions and biochemical feedback on protease sensitivity, glycosylation status, and monoclonal antibody binding. Sources of likely conformational heterogeneity such as N-linked carbohydrates, flexible or mobile N and C termini, and variable internal loops were reduced or eliminated, and ligands such as CD4 and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of monoclonal antibodies were used to restrict conformational mobility as well as to alter the crystallization surface. Through successive cycles of manipulation involving 18 different variants, we succeeded in growing six different types of gp120 crystals. One of these, a ternary complex composed of gp120, its receptor CD4, and the Fab of the human neutralizing monoclonal antibody 17b, diffracts to a minimum Bragg spacing of at least 2.2 A and is suitable for structural analysis.\n",

      "Resumo: The germline genes used by the mouse to generate the esterolytic antibody 48G7 were cloned and expressed in an effort to increase our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the immune system evolves catalytic function. The nine replacement mutations that were fixed during affinity maturation increased affinity for the transition state analogue by a factor of 10(4), primarily the result of a decrease in the dissociation rate of the hapten-antibody complex. There was a corresponding increase in the rate of reaction of antibody with substrate, k(cat)/k(m), from 1.7 x 10(2)M(-1) min(-1) to 1.4 x 10(4)M(-1) min(-1). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the 48G7-transition state analogue complex at 2.0 angstroms resolution indicates that one of the nine residues in which somatic mutations have been fixed directly contact the hapten. Thus, in the case of 48G7, affinity maturation appears to play a conformational role, either in reorganizing the active site geometry of limiting side-chain and backbone flexibility of the germline antibody. The crystal structure and analysis of somatic and directed active site mutants underscore the role of transition state stabilization in the evolution of this catalytic antibody.\n",

Specific antibodies that interact with the cellular prion protein have been shown to inhibit this transition. Recombinant VHHs (variable domain of dromedary heavy-chain antibodies) or nanobodies are single-domain antibodies, making them the smallest antigen-binding fragments. A specific nanobody (Nb_PrP_01) was raised against mouse PrPC. A crystallization condition for this recombinant nanobody was identified using high-throughput screening. The crystals were optimized using streak-seeding and the hanging-drop method.

      "Resumo: A strategy to overexpress T cell receptors (TCRs) in Lec3.2.8.1 cells has been developed using the \"Velcro\" leucine zipper sequence to facilitate alpha-beta pairing. Upon secretion in culture media, the VSV-8-specific/H2-Kb-restricted N15 TCR could be readily immunopurified using the anti-leucine zipper monoclonal antibody 2H11, with a yield of 5-10 mg/liter. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all attached glycans were GlcNAc2-Man5. Following Superdex 200 gel filtration to remove aggregates, wild-type N15 or N15(s), a C183S variant lacking the unpaired cysteine at amino acid residue 183 in the Cbeta domain, was thrombin-cleaved and endoglycosidase H-digested, and the two derivatives were termed iN15DeltaH and N15(s)DeltaH, respectively, and sized by Superdex 75 chromatography to high purity. N-terminal and C-terminal microsequencing analysis showed the expected unique termini of N15 alpha and beta subunits. Nevertheless, neither protein crystallized under a wide range of conditions. Subsequently, we produced a Fab fragment of the murine TCR Cbeta-specific hamster monoclonal antibody H57 and complexed the Fab fragment with iN15DeltaH and N15(s)DeltaH. Both N15(s)DeltaH-Fab[H57] and iN15DeltaH-Fab[H57] complexes crystallize, with the former diffracting to 2.8-A resolution. These findings show that neither intact glycans nor the conserved and partially exposed Cys-183 is required for protein stability. Furthermore, our results suggest that the H57 Fab fragment aids in the crystallization of TCRs by altering their molecular surface and/or stabilizing inherent conformational mobility.\n",

To our knowledge, these structures are the highest resolution catalytic antibody structures to date and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of this antibody-catalyzed monooxygenation reaction. Specifically, the data suggest that entropic restriction plays a fundamental role in catalysis through the precise alignment of the thioether substrate and oxidant. The antibody active site also stabilizes developing charge on both sulfur and periodate in the transition state via cation-pi and electrostatic interactions, respectively. In addition to demonstrating that the active site of antibody 28B4 does indeed reflect the mechanistic information programmed in the aminophosphonic acid hapten, these high-resolution structures provide a basis for enhancing turnover rates through mutagenesis and improved hapten design.\n",

IgG1 antibody solutions were concentrated from 20 to 100 mg/mL by intermediate precipitation, with a recovery exceeding 95%, retention of the native secondary structure and binding activity as well as adequate stability. Quantitative, reproducible precipitation was performed using 1.45 M ammonium sulphate (pH 5.5 and 8.0), 0.67 M sodium citrate (pH 8.0) and 9% (w/v) PEG 4000 (pH 5.5 and 8.0). Scalability was confirmed from 1 to 100 mL. The concentrations achievable in the re-dissolution step were less affected by the re-dissolution medium, but limited by the residual precipitant. Both, improved removal of remaining precipitant liquid and larger precipitation scales were successful in increasing the final protein concentration. SEC and turbidity analysis directly after re-dissolution indicated that similar protein qualities were obtained, independent from the precipitant used. However, increased aggregate formation was observed after short term storage of the precipitated protein particles at either 2-8 degrees C or ambient temperature. An accelerated mechanical and thermal stability program verified comparable stability of the re-dissolved liquid 100 mg/mL formulations produced by intermediate precipitation to a control formulation obtained by standard ultrafiltration.\n",

      "Resumo: Stimulating, and some blocking, antibodies to the TSH receptor (TSHR) have conformation-dependent epitopes reported to involve primarily the leucine rich repeat region of the ectodomain (LRD). However, successful crystallization of TSHR residues 22-260 has omitted important extracellular non-LRD residues including the hinge region which connects the TSHR ectodomain to the transmembrane domain and which is involved in ligand induced signal transduction. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine if TSHR antibodies (TSHR-Abs) have non-LRD binding sites outside the LRD. To obtain this information we employed the method of epitope protection in which we first protected TSHR residues 1-412 with intact TSHR antibodies and then enzymatically digested the unprotected residues. Those peptides remaining were subsequently delineated by mass spectrometry. Fourteen out of 23 of the reported stimulating monoclonal TSHR-Ab crystal contact residues were protected by this technique which may reflect the higher binding energies of certain residues detected in this approach. Comparing the protected epitopes of two stimulating TSHR-Abs we found both similarities and differences but both antibodies also contacted the hinge region and the amino terminus of the TSHR following the signal peptide and encompassing cysteine box 1 which has previously been shown to be important for TSH binding and activation. A monoclonal blocking TSHR antibody revealed a similar pattern of binding regions but the residues that it contacted on the LRD were again distinct. These data demonstrated that conformationally dependent TSHR-Abs had epitopes not confined to the LRDs but also incorporated epitopes not revealed in the available crystal structure. Furthermore, the data also indicated that in addition to overlapping contact regions within the LRD, there are unique epitope patterns for each of the antibodies which may contribute to their functional heterogeneity.\n",

When bacteria face an unfavourable environment, the antitoxin is degraded and the free toxin VapC targets important cellular processes in order to inhibit cell growth. TA systems function in many biological processes, such as in the stringent response, in biofilm formation and in drug tolerance.

      "Resumo: In the absence of a method to ensure that crystals can be obtained for any given protein, the possibility of developing scaffolds for protein crystallisation becomes attractive. Among several approaches that could yield scaffolds, two are particularly promising: the first is based on immunoglobulin Fab fragments and immunoglobulin binding proteins while the second is based on fusion proteins. In the Fab based scaffold, the protein of interest is the antigen recognised by the antibody. In the second case, it is a protein fused to one of the scaffold components. The operational difference between the two methods is the existence of a flexible covalent tether compared to a highly specific interaction. The relative merits and disadvantages of each approach are discussed here. We also describe a lattice obtained through a combinatorial approach which appears to have the required properties to be considered a scaffold. The system makes use of an Fab derived from a rheumatoid factor and an Fc-fusion protein. The Fc-fusion system is ideal for enhanced expression of glycoproteins in mammalian cells and provides a useful tag for their purification. The molecular replacement shows a mode of binding for this rheumatoid factor that is not competitive with bacterial Fc-binding proteins. Hence it may be possible to generalize the method to include bacterial expression of fusion proteins with either protein A or protein G as the fusion partner.\n",

      "Resumo: A survey of crystallization conditions was carried out for 650 published protein-protein complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB). This resulted in the establishment of a Protein Complex Crystallization Database (PCCD) and a set of configuration-space boundaries for protein-complex crystallizations. Overall, polyethylene glycol (PEG) based conditions accounted for 70-80% of all crystallizations, with PEG 3000-4000, 5000-6000 and 8000 being the most frequently used. The median values of PEG concentrations were between 10 and 20% and were inversely correlated with their molecular weights. Ammonium sulfate remained the most favorable salt precipitant, with a median concentration of 1.6 M. The crystallization pH for the vast majority of protein complexes was between 5.0 and 8.0. Overall, the boundaries for the crystallization configuration space of protein complexes appear to be more restricted than those of soluble proteins. This may reflect the limited stability and solubility of protein-protein complexes. Based on statistical analysis of the database, a sparse-matrix and a systematic buffer and pH screen were formulated to best represent the crystallization of protein complexes.\n",

      "Resumo: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a central role in the allergic response, in which cross-linking of allergen by FcεRI-bound IgE triggers mast cell and basophil degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators. The high-affinity interaction between IgE and FcεRI is a long-standing target for therapeutic intervention in allergic disease. Omalizumab is a clinically approved anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that binds to free IgE, also with high affinity, preventing its interaction with FcεRI. All attempts to crystallize the pre-formed complex between the omalizumab Fab and the Fc region of IgE (IgE-Fc), to understand the structural basis for its mechanism of action, surprisingly failed. Instead, the Fab alone selectively crystallized in different crystal forms, but their structures revealed intermolecular Fab/Fab interactions that were clearly strong enough to disrupt the Fab/IgE-Fc complexes. Some of these interactions were common to other Fab crystal structures. Mutations were therefore designed to disrupt two recurring packing interactions observed in the omalizumab Fab crystal structures without interfering with the ability of the omalizumab Fab to recognize IgE-Fc; this led to the successful crystallization and subsequent structure determination of the Fab/IgE-Fc complex. The mutagenesis strategy adopted to achieve this result is applicable to other intractable Fab/antigen complexes or systems in which Fabs are used as crystallization chaperones.\n",

In each case, papain digestion of the immunoglobulins produced a mixture of Fab species differing in their isoelectric points. Purification of one of these species was required to obtain suitable crystals. One of these antibodies, Jel 72, is specific for right-handed duplex poly(dG).poly(dC). An Fab fragment of Jel 72 with a pI of 8.8 was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and used to obtain crystals from 56% saturated ammonium sulfate and 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.2, that diffract to 2.6-A resolution. They belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions of a = 94.6, b = 102.6, c = 92.4 A. The other antibody, Jel 318, binds triple-stranded DNA poly[d(Tm5C)].poly[d(GA)].poly[d(m5C + T)]. Jel 318 Fab fragments with isoelectric points of 7.6 and 7.8 were also purified by anion-exchange chromatography, and crystals were obtained from 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.8. These crystals diffract to about 2.4-A resolution and also belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions of a = 82.4, b = 139.5, and c = 42.0 A. For both Fab fragments, crystal size and quality improved dramatically upon purification of an individual isoelectric species.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25849400\n",
      "Resumo: Crystallization chaperones are attracting increasing interest as a route to crystal growth and structure elucidation of difficult targets such as membrane proteins. While strategies to date have typically employed protein-specific chaperones, a peptide-specific chaperone to crystallize multiple cognate peptide epitope-containing client proteins is envisioned. This would eliminate the target-specific chaperone-production step and streamline the co-crystallization process. Previously, protein engineering and directed evolution were used to generate a single-chain variable (scFv) antibody fragment with affinity for the peptide sequence EYMPME (scFv/EE). This report details the conversion of scFv/EE to an anti-EE Fab format (Fab/EE) followed by its biophysical characterization. The addition of constant chains increased the overall stability and had a negligible impact on the antigen affinity. The 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of Fab/EE reveals contacts with larger surface areas than those of scFv/EE. Surface plasmon resonance, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and size-exclusion chromatography were used to assess Fab/EE binding to EE-tagged soluble and membrane test proteins: namely, the β-barrel outer membrane protein intimin and α-helical A2a G protein-coupled receptor (A2aR). Molecular-dynamics simulation of the intimin constructs with and without Fab/EE provides insight into the energetic complexities of the co-crystallization approach.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023832\n",
      "Resumo: Malaria is a global health burden, with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (Pv) responsible for the majority of infections worldwide. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the most abundant protein on the surface of <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites, and antibodies targeting the central repeat region of CSP can prevent parasite infection. Although much has been uncovered about the molecular basis of antibody recognition of the PfCSP repeats, data remains scarce for PvCSP. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for peptides comprising the PvCSP repeats from strains VK210 and VK247 to reveal how the PvCSP central repeats are highly disordered, with minor propensities to adopt turn conformations. Next, we solved eight crystal structures to unveil the interactions of two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2F2 and 2E10.E9, with PvCSP repeats. Both antibodies can accommodate subtle sequence variances in the repeat motifs and recognize largely coiled peptide conformations that also contain isolated turns. Our structural studies uncover various degrees of Fab-Fab homotypic interactions upon recognition of the PvCSP central repeats by these two inhibitory mAbs, similar to potent mAbs against PfCSP. These findings augment our understanding of host<i>-Plasmodium</i> interactions and contribute molecular details of Pv inhibition by mAbs to unlock structure-based engineering of PvCSP-based vaccines.\n",

      "Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8478919\n",
      "Resumo: Fc receptors expressed in the gut of newborn rodents bind to maternal immunoglobulin in milk at pH 6.5, and transport it to the bloodstream of the neonate, where it dissociates at pH 7.4. The rat intestinal Fc receptor (FcRn) consists of a heavy chain, with significant sequence similarity to the heavy chain of class I MHC molecules, complexed to the class I light chain, beta 2-microglobulin. Although FcRn is predicted to contain a groove analogous to that which serves as the MHC peptide-binding site, the immunoglobulin ligand of FcRn is a macromolecule instead of a peptide. We have expressed and crystallized a secreted form of FcRn, and here report the crystallization of a complex between FcRn and its Fc ligand. Isolated FcRn-Fc complexes crystallize in space group I222 or I2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions a = 125 A, b = 152 A and c = 216 A. The crystals diffract to 5.5 A resolution with anisotropic diffraction to 3.5 A. Data collection from cryopreserved crystals may allow the resolution limit to be extended, since the major reason for the poor resolution appears to be radiation decay. Even a low-resolution view of how FcRn binds Fc would be of interest to see if the binding site corresponds to the functional part of an MHC molecule. Since the structure of Fc is known, and a structure determination of FcRn is underway, it may be possible to locate the Fc binding site on FcRn at low resolution. As an initial characterization of the FcRn-Fc mode of interaction, and to facilitate the structure determination, we have determined the stoichiometry of binding of FcRn to Fc. We show that two FcRn molecules bind per Fc, as determined by analysis of gels of washed crystals, a column binding assay, and isothermal titration calorimetry.\n",
